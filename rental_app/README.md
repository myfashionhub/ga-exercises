# Rental Application

* Owners of buildings can rent apartments to potential tenants

* This is a multi-file project that has a main file for working with the objects, and each class as separate files.

* In a main.rb file, demonstrate the functionality of your classes.

* Write a loop: until the user wants to quit, iterate and be able to create a building, an apartment or a tenant. It is completely OK if your code dies because you try to modify an object that doesn't exist, but if you put guards (conditionals) to avoid that, bonus points!
